# Steam-Customer-Segmentation
Uses KMeans to categorize customers based on number of games purchased by genre. 

The clusters themselves aren't really the interesting part, because KMeans just grouped users into low, med, and high purchase categories. But make sure to check out the genre preferences of users who are in the low-purchase clusters, users that have around 2-4 purchases total, compared to users who make a few more purchases. For instance casual versus indie game genres. You'll a preference towards purchasing casual over indie titles. Why? Probably many reasons, but having insights like this can help an indie developer choose what kind of game to make based on popularilty of that genre on Steam.
