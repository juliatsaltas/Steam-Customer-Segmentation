# Steam-Customer-Segmentation
Uses KMeans to categorize customers based on number of games purchased by genre. There are 3 clusters identifying users that as low-purchases, medium-purchases and high purchases.

These clusters aren't really the interesting part, but rather check out the genre preferences of users who are in the low-purchase clusters, users that have around 2-4 purchases total, compared to users who make a few more purchases.

- On the left hand column there are drop down lists were you can compare popularity (based on purchases) of games between user types.
